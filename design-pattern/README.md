### Introduction 

* Design patterns are design level solutions for recurring problems that we software engineers come across often.

* Using these patterns is considered good practice, as the design of the solution is quite tried and tested, resulting in higher readability of the final code. 

### Types

These 26 can be classified into 3 types:

1. [Creational](https://github.com/abhisheksurve45/software-engg-notes/tree/master/design-pattern/creational) : Provides a way to create new objects which increases the flexibility and reusability.

2. Structural: Helps to structure & assemble objects and classes while making them flexible.

3. Behavioral: Helps to communicate between objects and concerned with responsibilities between objects.
